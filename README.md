# Machine_Learning_with_Caret

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to build a machine learning pipeline and train a predictive model in R using the [caret package](https://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html). For the purposes of this simple demonstration I used data from the [Titanic prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview) competition in Kaggle.

In the end, I was able to build a series of models and compare their ability to predict accurately wether a passenger in the Titanic would survive or not.
